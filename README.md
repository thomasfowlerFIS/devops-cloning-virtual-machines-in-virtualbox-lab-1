# **Cloning a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox**

## **Lab Excercise 1**

* Clone an existing virtual machine in VirtualBox and configure
the clone so it is considered a unique machine on a network.

* Start the virtual machine clone alongside the original virtual
machine and catalog the differences between the two.

* Experiment with various settings and note observations (e.g. default
configuration, network settings, hardware configuration, etc.)
